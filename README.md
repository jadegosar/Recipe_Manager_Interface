# Recipe Creator and Manager

A recipe creator and manager is a program that can be used to create, store, organize and manage recipes. It is comprised of features the that allow users to add new recipes, categorize them, and also search for recipes based on ingredients or categories. This was a final group project for the 'Python Programming' course I took during my graduate studies. We were tasked with creating a program that allowed for user interaction with the recipe manager database and incorporated safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of the program so only those who were meant to have access could get access. In this case, the database was a very simple one only containg three tables; recipe, ingredients, and user data. The real purpose of the project was to go through every step in the process from creating a database to creating a program that could interact with the database based on the user's desired action.

The files posted in this repository are the final write-up, slide deck used in the final presentation, and the code that runs the the program based on excel files we created to hold the original recipe manager information.
